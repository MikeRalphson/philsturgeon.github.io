excerpt: Kapture is a Brooklyn-based company I've been working for this last year
  as Lead Engineer. We make an iPhone app which essentially rewards users for sharing
  a photograph of a specific opportunity with their friends on Facebook, Twitter or
  (coming soon) Foursquare. This at its most basic level means if I share a photograph
  of my food when I go to one of our partner restaurants, I could get a glass of wine,
  or a desert, or whatever that partner is doing, for free. Beyond that we have all
  sorts of people on board, from shoe shops to hotels, and plenty more verticals are
  covered too.

I've been with [Kapture](http://kaptu.re/) nearly a year now, which is weird for me as a developer who was very happy doing my own thing with HappyNinjas. I vowed to never work for anyone else again based on some bad (and boring) experiences prior to my self-employed career, but I'm really glad I changed my mind.

Kapture is a Brooklyn-based company building an app which I really believe is going to be big. Essentially it rewards users for sharing a photograph of a specific opportunity with their friends on Facebook, Twitter or (coming soon) Foursquare. This at its most basic level means if I share a photograph of my food when I go to one of our partner restaurants, I could get a glass of wine, or a desert, or whatever that partner is doing, for free. Beyond that we have all sorts of people on board, from shoe shops to hotels, and plenty more verticals are covered too. 

We've been live for several months, had some amazing coverage and had wonderful feedback from our early adopters. Now we are getting ready for the next big version of our application to go public, and it's the perfect time for me to try and find more developers to help me out.

So, I am looking for a Senior level LAMPish developer to join the team here at Kapture, to help build new features, increase test coverage on the existing codebase and add awesome new functionality like a merchant dashboard, to let anyone anywhere in the world add campaigns to our system. We're also looking for a Junior developer, and I'm ok with helping out a developer who is still learning how some of these technologies work, as long as they are a quick learner who likes to experiment with new technology.

The position is on-site here in our Dumbo office, in Brooklyn, NY. No remote working, and sadly we can't help you get a working visa. If you're able to work in the US then you're a candidate.

## Down to the Details

How good you are with these technologies depends on if you're aiming for the Junior or Senior role. You'll be working with very similar stuff either way, but the less help you need the better.

### Knowledge of these minimum technologies and concepts
* PHP
* MySQL
* Git
* RESTful API’s

### Knowledge of these technologies is considered a bonus
* Laravel 4
* EmberJS
* MongoDB
* Redis
* Python
* Chef
* Jenkins
* Capistrano

I've put a more descriptive listing for the [Senior Dev role](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/jobs/33569/senior-php-api-developer-kapture-life) up on the StackOverflow Careers site too, but it's saying pretty much the same thing as this. If you are this person, or you know somebody that might be interest, you should get in touch.

## Why Kapture? 

There are plenty of jobs going around. Demand for PHP devs is ridiculous these days and I can always name at least 5 of my friends trying to find somebody at any given point, but Kapture is an excellent company to come work for, for a variety of reasons:

### Casual working environment

This is not a stuck-up office, so relax. The office is big enough to ride a bike around, and I've proven that theory.

### All about open-source

If you make something awesome that could be a PHP Composer package, then you should absolutely release that and blog about it. If we're not behind on a deadline then that blog article can be done on a Friday afternoon, probably with a beer.

### We use whatever technology we want

There are lots of elements to Kapture, from the admin panel (Laravel 4 and Bootstrap), the merchant panel (EmberJS), the API itself (Laravel 4 too) and the worker processes (Python).

Intermixed with all that we use a little Redis, Mongo (*sparingly!!*) and MySQL. We can use whatever tool is deemed best instead of sticking to whatever X technology the boss has heard is probably a good idea from his nephew who made a website once.

### No legacy code-base

I spent the last year destroying the previous API which would score so highly on the PHP Mess Detector that it would cause a universe implosion. That is going into deprecation mode as soon as v3.0 of the app is in the store, and everything else is new fangled and sexy. This means we can use PHP 5.4 and as soon as PHP 5.5 comes out we'll be upgrading to that too. New hotness, not "but if we update it might break things so we'd better use PHP 5.1 for the next decade…".

### No red-tape

I've worked in large offices where you have to get a whole essay of an RFC written up, countersigned and dated by 3 of your bosses to get a typ0 fixed on the homepage. Fuck that noise.

We get paid to write awesome code, and that is what we'll be doing. Help me write and test more code, so we can help Kapture reach its full potential. I want a boat.

Get in touch with me on the contact form if you want to talk to me specifically or hit up [joinus@kaptu.re](mailto:joinus@kaptu.re) with a copy of your resume and a link to your GitHub profile. You don't NEED to have a huge profile, but if you can show you know how open-source works and give us an example of your work then it'll certainly help.
