title: CoC's Are Harsh And Vague

1. CC is too harsh,

It is by no means harsh. The concern comes from:

> Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

That means, for example, if The PHP League were to implement this CoC, we're announcing to the users of our projects that if project leads are causing trouble, you can report them just like anyone else.

This is letting people know its not just other contributors, but project leads too. Everyone in the community follows the same rules.

Conferences do the same these days, and outline that sponsors are also under the rules, not just attendees.

People often use "Opalgate" to suggest that just because Coraline wrote this CoC, she would somehow be able to run around firing anyone at will, which is not only a bit misguided, but literally not true.

Imagine the same opalgate thread happening in PHP with the mediation process outlined there. It would be locked and closed down immediately, with a reply saying "Please contact mediation@php.net" and that's the end of it.

No drama. No problems. Just private mediation. Ideal.

Coralines CoC would protect people who are scared of it. People like Paul would just be reported in mediation, and if it was baseless it would be thrown out. Simple.

2. and too vague, which can lead to abuse.

The vagueness is wildly important. The document outlines the kind of behavior that is unacceptable, without giving a red/green light to every single possible behavior that could be good or bad.

This is for a few reasons. Firstly, if you give people a clear line, they'll walk right up to that line and piss over the edge. By allowing context to be used, you'll reduce
the "well actually' BS from people, and stop people being allowed to continue their harasment based on technicalities.

3. Some people are trying to point out the above and getting screamed at by pro-CoC people who think anyone who isn't a 100% fan of CC is a bastard of some sort.

I've seen this happen once or twice with a tweet or two, but this is out of hundreds of conversations on the topic. I've set people straight on the difference.

The vast majority of people who are trying to explain the benefits of a CoC are doing so in a calm and collection fashion, but many people flip out with Paul's BS. If you've not seen as much BS from him
as we have then you'll be much more likely to think we're overreacting.

If anyone is shouting at you specifically because you have concerns with specific parts of a CoC then let me know and I'll be the first to tell them to back off.

Constructive criticism is absolutely ok. However most anti-CoC people are trolling, and making nonsense arguments (like the posts I've had to write explaining to paul thats literally not how CoCs work. multiple times)

4. Paul is trying to point out 1 and 2, but is having 3 happen.

Paul is not trying to point out valid concerns, he's confused about how CoCs work and ignoring, mocking or misrepresenting people that try to help him understand.

He acts like white men will be the victims of malintentioned women, who will use and abuse this to mess with people for political reasons. The idea that this would happen anything more than 1/1000 times, when women and minorities are victimized and harassed consistently is... well mind blowing.

His paranoid concerns that the people who handle mediation reports will just instafire white dudes at the whim of "gender politics SJWs" is not only offensive but its definitively misogynist. Pretty much the only instance of this happening people can provide is Brendan Eich, which has nothing to do with CoCs >.<

5. Pitchfork mobs

Paul will talk about mobs a lot. I have pointed out how destructive these are, and hope to hell this doesn't happen in the PHP community when we have discussions about CoCs, as has done in other communites (that ruby thread...)

That said Paul is regularly confused between a pitchfork mob and a bunch of people calling him on his shit. He'll say something a lot of people disagree with (wildly offensive, not based in fact, and highlighting paranoid delusions) and when a bunch of people say "WTF" it's a pitchfork mob.

He currently has 20 complaints against him in the FIG, for exactly this sort of thing. It's not just me dude, im just the most verbal. He's completely gone off the rocker since these CoC chats started, and it's time he stopped.
