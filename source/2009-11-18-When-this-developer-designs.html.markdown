For far too long this blog felt tainted. It's quality diminished by using a free design from [Free CSS Templates](http://freecsstemplates.org/). Well no more, I have finally had a crack at designing and after a few horrendous iterations I have something that I am happy with.

It may not be a graphical masterpiece, nor will I be winning any awards for it, but it is mine and that is good enough for me.

Oh and its HTML 5 too so it looks _ **disgusting** _ in IE6. Let's consider that to be a win!

Font and text sizes are not perfect so they will be worked on, and I had some plans to implement @font-face on the header. This will all be done soon, but for now it is back to working on [PyroCMS](http://pyrocms.com/) [v0.9.8](http://github.com/philsturgeon/pyrocms/tree/v0.9.8-dev) as its already a few days past due.

For any of you nerdy developer types with the design skills of a drunk beaver, take a look at [When developers design](http://boagworld.com/design/when-developers-design). It is an old article but has some great advice for those of us more used to an IDE than Photoshop.
