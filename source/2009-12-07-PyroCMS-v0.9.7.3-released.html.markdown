After a long wait the new stable PyroCMS has been released which adds German language support and a bunch of other bug-fixes. It might not be anything crazy exciting but if you are using PyroCMS already it will take care of pretty much any bug you might have noticed so far.

If you aren't already using PyroCMS because you heard about the Apache crashing PHP 5.3 bug: good news. This release should stop your server crashing on the final installer stage.
