    %em If you're into APIs, I've written a whole book called <a href="https://apisyouwonthate.com/?utm_source=philsturgeon.uk&utm_content=api-tag-footer">Build APIs You Won't Hate</a>, and it's available in ebook or paperback form! If programming books normally bore the crap out of you, this book is for you.
