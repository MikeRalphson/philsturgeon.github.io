I've been programming since I was about 12, writing awful messes in spaghetti PHP. 16 years later and I have learned how to a) program in a bunch of other languages, and, b) make PHP be a better place. Years have been shaved off my lifespan, fighting to help make better education resources, quality standards, and push new functionality into the core.

Tech startups brought me from Bristol to Newcastle, finally to New York. [WeWork](https://wework.com) is offering me the chance to work on amazing stuff as a Platform Engineer, where I split my time between improving legacy services, and green field API development.

Our definition of Platform Engineer is: providing tools, APIs/services and guidelines that help all/many other development teams. It sits between Devops and Developer Happyness, which makes me happy. We're the oil that keeps the insanely big cogs turning.

The theme of the last few decades has been: taking on complex topics, breaking them down into undersandable chunks, then writing, podcasting, and blogging about it as much as possible. These days it's [REST](/tag/rest/), [GraphQL](/tag/graphql) and [API Specifications](/tag/api-specs).

I love to teach, and if I'm not [speaking](/speaking/) at a conference near you, then maybe we can do some [remote consulting](https://clarity.fm/philsturgeon).
