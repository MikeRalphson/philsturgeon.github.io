Is anybody else getting really bored of Twitter news? These days it seems to be everywhere; you cannot get away from it. I realize right now I am adding to the millions of blog posts, news articles and newspaper headlines that contain the word "Twitter" but this is not an article about Twitter, it is an article _about idiots writing about Twitter_.

I'll start by saying I am a Twitter user. I have the [TwitBin Firefox add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/7631) on my laptop, work computer and have [Tweeterific](http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific)on my iPhone. This, does not mean I want every RSS feed I subscribe to, every magazine I look at and every news site I visit to bombard me with articles about their views on [Twitters eventual monetization](http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-10161103-93.html), [how many hits the site is getting a day](http://www.geek.com/articles/news/twitter-visitors-jump-131-since-february-20090417/), [how many followers Ashton Kutcher has](http://www.businessinsider.com/ashton-kutcher-passes-2-million-twitter-followers-2009-6), [how it is going to change the world](http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,1902604,00.html) & [how we live](http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2009/03/the-twitter-platform-3-years-old-and-ready-to-change-the-world.php) or [how unsafe it is](http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/159981/three_ways_twitter_security_fails.html).

Let's put my views on the subject to a single point.

"I do not care!"

I didn't really care when Twitter launched their site. I continued to not care for well over a year while I carried on living my life. I registered to test out some client work and continued not caring. I even didn't care after I registered a personal account and started gaining a few followers.

The whole world of media seems to think Twitter is the most amazing thing to happen since sliced bread. To me, it is just a mix of RSS, e-mail and instant messenger, the only difference: it is open and shorter. This does not mean it has changed the world (or even my life) and for God's sake I do not want 30% of my news intake to be saturated by constant pointless articles about it.

The part that really sticks in my throat is that all is that articles are not just from teenage bloggers with nothing to write about. Many of these are from paid journalists working for companies such as like Time Magazine, Business Insider, Telegraph, CNN and plenty more. I really can't help but find it all completely ridiculous as there is so many more interesting things going on in the world wide web.

I write this post in the hope that bloggers (both hobbyist and professional) out there will see it and perhaps realize how pathetic they are being. If you like Twitter, use it. If you don't then don't! Either way: well done, you have an opinion. Shut up writing about Twitter as it's old news now and nobody cares!
